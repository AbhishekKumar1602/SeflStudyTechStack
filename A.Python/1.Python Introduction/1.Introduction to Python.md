# Introduction to Python

> Python is a High-Level Interpreted Multi-Paradigm Programming Language with First Class Functions and Automatic Memory Management. Explain each line and Keywords

1. **High-Level:** Python is considered a high-level programming language, designed for human readability and abstraction from low-level hardware details. This abstraction allows developers to focus on program logic without dealing with low-level implementation.

2. **Interpreted:** Python is primarily an interpreted language, executed line by line by the Python interpreter at runtime. This provides flexibility but may impact performance compared to compiled languages.

3. **Multi-Paradigm:** Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles. This versatility enables developers to choose the best approach for specific tasks.

4. **First Class Functions:** In Python, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This feature enhances Python's capabilities for functional programming.

5. **Automatic Memory Management:** Python employs automatic memory management, handling memory allocation and deallocation through a garbage collector. This reduces the risk of memory-related errors for developers.

Python is a versatile and widely used programming language, suitable for various applications, such as web development, scientific computing, automation, and more. Its readability, multi-paradigm support, and automatic memory management make it a popular choice for many developers.

   - The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It manages hardware resources and provides essential services to other software. It serves as an intermediary between applications and the hardware.
   - **Example:** The Linux kernel, developed by Linus Torvalds, is responsible for tasks like managing memory, scheduling processes, and handling input and output.

2. **Distribution (Distro):**
   - A Linux distribution is a complete operating system package that includes the Linux kernel, system utilities, libraries, and application software. Distributions are often tailored for specific use cases or user preferences.
   - **Example:** Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS are popular Linux distributions, each with its unique features and package management systems.

3. **Boot Loader:**
   - The boot loader is a small program that initiates the operating system's boot process. It loads the kernel into memory and starts the OS.
   - **Example:** GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a commonly used boot loader in Linux. It presents users with a menu to choose between different operating systems during startup.

4. **Services:**
   - Services in Linux are background processes or daemons that perform various tasks, such as network services, system maintenance, and hardware control.
   - **Example:** The Apache web server is a service that runs in the background, serving web pages to users' browsers.

5. **File System:**
   - A file system is a method of organizing and storing files on a storage device, such as a hard drive or SSD. Linux supports various file systems, and they determine how data is stored and accessed.
   - **Example:** The ext4 file system is commonly used in Linux for storing and managing files on storage devices.

6. **X-Window System (X11):**
   - The X-Window System is a graphical user interface framework that allows for the display of graphics and user interaction in a windowed environment. It provides the foundation for desktop environments and graphical applications.
   - **Example:** Xorg is the most widely used X-Window System server in Linux.

7. **Desktop Environment:**

   - **Example:** To list the files in a directory, you can use the "ls" command in the command line, like this: `ls /path/to/directory`.

### Root
There are 3 Types of Root in Linux System

1. **Root Account:** The "root" account in Linux is the superuser or administrator account. It has the highest level of privileges and can perform any administrative task, including modifying system files and settings. The root account is identified by the username "root." When you log in as the root user, you have unrestricted access to the entire system.

2. **Root as Directory(/):** In Linux, the term "root" is also used to refer to the top-level directory of the file system. The root directory is denoted by the forward slash ("/"). It is the starting point for the file hierarchy, and all other directories and files are organized beneath it. The root directory is sometimes called the root filesystem.

3. **Root as Homme Directory(/root):** The term "root" can also refer to the home directory of the root user. In this context, "root" is both the superuser and has a home directory, typically located at /root. The root user's home directory may contain configuration files and data specific to the root user.

### Terminal
- A terminal, also known as a shell, is a program that allows users to interact with their operating system through a command-line interface.
- It provides a way for users to execute commands, navigate files, install software packages, and perform various tasks on their system without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). 
- In Linux, the default terminal emulator is called "Bash," which stands for Bourne-again shell.

**Components of a Terminal in Linux:**
1. **Shell:** The shell is a command-line interpreter that processes the commands entered by the user and executes them.
2. **Terminal Emulator:** It is a program that emulates a physical terminal in the system along with providing a GUI to interact with the shell and run commands. It offers several advantages over physical terminals, including the ability to customize the font and color scheme, check for an error message, and other settings like reproducing a video terminal. They also provide users with the ability to copy and paste text in the executable files, scroll through the binary program, background transparency and resize the window terminal application.
3. **Prompt:** The prompt is a symbol or text string that indicates the readiness of the shell to accept a command. It usually includes the current working directory, username, and hostname.
4. **Command Line:** The command line is the area where the user types command to interact with the shell.
5. **Standard Input/Output/Error:** The standard input/output/error (stdin, stdout, stderr) are the streams through which the shell communicates with the user and the system. The standard input (stdin) accepts input from the user, the standard output (stdout) displays output to the user, and the standard error (stderr) displays error messages.
6. **History:** The history feature allows the user to view and recall previously executed commands.
7. **Environment Variables:** Environment variables are variables that contain information about the system and the user's environment. They can be used to customize the behavior of the shell and the programs that run within it.
8. **Text Editor:** A text editor is a program that allows the user to edit different text files. It can be used to create and modify configuration files, scripts, and other text-based documents.

**Sample Terminal Session**
```
nimer@ghost:~$
```
or
```
nimer@ghost:/$
```
- **`nimer`**: This is the username.
- **`ghost`**: This is the hostname of the machine.
- **`~`**: This indicates that the current working directory is the user's home directory.
- **`/`**: This indicates that the current working directory is the root directory. 
- **`$`**: This is the command prompt, indicating that the system is ready to accept commands.


## Linux File System and Partition - File System
The Linux file system is the structure and organization of files, directories, and data on a Linux-based operating system. It defines how data is stored, accessed, and managed on storage devices like hard drives, solid-state drives, and networked storage. The Linux file system is a hierarchical tree-like structure, starting from the root directory and branching into subdirectories and files. 

**Key Aspects Related to File System in Linux**

1. **Root Directory (/):**
   - The root directory, symbolized by a forward slash (/), occupies the highest tier in the Linux file system hierarchy.
   - All other directories and files derive their existence and organization from the root directory, making it the starting point for the entire file system.

2. **Directories and Subdirectories:**
   - Directories in Linux act as containers for grouping and organizing files and other directories.
   - This hierarchical structuring facilitates efficient data organization and retrieval, enabling users to manage their data systematically.

3. **Files:**
   - Files in Linux are diverse, ranging from data files and programs to scripts, configuration files, and soft links.
   - Files are stored within directories, forming the building blocks of the file system.

4. **Path:**
   - Paths are strings that specify the location of a file or directory in the file system.
   - Two main types of paths are employed:
     - **Absolute Path:** Provides the complete path from the root directory, e.g., /home/user/documents/file.txt.
     - **Relative Path:** Specifies the path relative to the current working directory, e.g., if in /home/user, the relative path to documents/file.txt suffices.

5. **File System Types:**
   - Linux supports multiple file system types, each with its characteristics:
     - **ext4:** Widely used and default for many distributions, known for stability and performance.
     - **ext3:** An earlier version of ext4, featuring journaling capabilities.
     - **Btrfs:** A modern file system with advanced features like snapshots and compression.
     - **XFS:** Recognized for scalability and high-performance characteristics.

6. **Mount Points:**
   - Linux allows the attachment of additional storage devices to specific directories known as "mount points."
   - This process enables users to access and interact with the data stored on the attached devices seamlessly.

7. **Permissions:**
   - Linux employs a robust permissions system to control access to files and directories.
   - Permissions are managed through attributes such as read (r), write (w), and execute (x) for the owner, group, and others.

8. **Inodes:**
   - Inodes are data structures crucial for storing metadata about files and directories.
   - Information such as file permissions, ownership, timestamps, and the actual data block locations on the storage device is contained within inodes.

9. **Links:**
   - A "link" refers to a mechanism that creates a connection or association between two files or directories. 
   - There are two primary types of links:
     - **Hard Links:** Multiple directory entries pointing to the same inode. Modifications in one hard link affect all hard links.
     - * soft Links (Symlinks):** These act as references to a file or directory through its path, serving as shortcuts. Symlinks can span different file systems.

10. **Special Files:**
    - Linux includes special files for devices, typically found in the /dev directory.
    - These device files allow interaction with hardware components, such as /dev/sda (representing a block device) or /dev/tty1 (representing a terminal device). 
    - Special files enable users and applications to communicate with and control hardware resources effectively.

### Structure of Linux File System
The Linux file system has a hierarchical structure, organized in a tree-like format. The root directory ("/") is at the top of this hierarchy, and all other directories and files are arranged beneath it.

### Root Directory ("/")
- The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux file system hierarchy. It is denoted by a forward slash ("/").
- All other directories and files in the system are organized beneath the root directory in a hierarchical tree structure.
- The root directory is the starting point for the entire file system.

**Structure of Root Directory**

- In Terminal Run
```
cd /  
```
Current directory will be set to the root directory.

- Now Run 
```
ls -la
```
It will show the structure of root directoty of linux machine which will look like:(Excluding Explanation Section)

- The line "total 2097252" is a summary line that indicates the total number of 1-kilobyte blocks used by the files and directories listed in the subsequent output. This value helps estimate the disk space used by the listed items.

- **Permissions**: The permissions column represents the access rights of the file or directory. These permissions are divided into three parts: owner, group, and others. Each part consists of three characters, which can be either a letter (r for read, w for write, x for execute) or a hyphen (-) to indicate the absence of that permission. The three parts together determine who can read, write, or execute the file or directory. For example, "rwxr-xr-x" indicates that the owner can read, write, and execute the file, while others can only read and execute it.

- **Links**: This column displays the number of hard links pointing to the file or directory. Hard links are multiple directory entries that point to the same underlying data on disk. Each hard link is essentially an additional name for the same file. This count indicates how many directory entries refer to the same data.

- **Owner User & Group**: In this column, you find information about the owner user and group associated with the file or directory. The owner user is the individual who has primary control over the file, while the owner group defines the group to which the file belongs. These settings determine who has specific access permissions for the file or directory.

- **Size**: This column indicates the size of the file or directory in bytes. For files, it represents the amount of storage space the file occupies on the file system. For directories, it typically indicates the amount of storage used by the directory's metadata, which includes information about the directory's contents.

- **Modified Date**: This column provides the date when the file or directory was last modified. It typically includes the month, day, and time of the modification. The modification date is crucial for tracking when changes were made to the file or directory.

- **Name**: The name column lists the name of the file or directory. It's the identifier used to access and reference the file or directory within the file system. The name helps users and applications locate and interact with the file or directory.

**NOTE** The first character in permission column represents the file type. It can be one of the following:
- `-`: This indicates a regular file. Regular files contain data, such as text files, binary files, or program executables.
- `d`: This indicates a directory. Directories are special files that contain a list of other files and directories.
- `l`: This indicates a symbolic link. Symbolic links are files that act as pointers or references to another file or directory.
- `c`: This indicates a character device file. Character devices are used to communicate with hardware devices, such as terminals or sound cards.
- `b`: This indicates a block device file. Block devices are used to interact with devices that store and retrieve data in fixed-size blocks, such as hard drives.
- `p`: This indicates a named pipe. Named pipes are special files used for inter-process communication.
- `s`: This indicates a socket. Sockets are special files that allow processes to communicate with each other.

2. **File and Directory Management**

- **Create New File**
```
touch filename
```
Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp if it exists.

- **Copy Existing File**
```
cp source_file destination
```

- **Create New Directory**
```
mkdir /path/to/new_directory
```
Creates a new directory in the specified path.
```
mkdir -p /path/to/new_directory
```
Creates the directory and its parent directories if they don't exist.

- **Copy Existing Directory**
```
cp -r source_directory destination_directory
```

3. **Searching for Files and Directories**

- Using find Command:
```
find /path/to/search -name filename / 'directoryname'
```

- Using locate Command:
```
updatedb
locate /path/to/search -name filename / 'directoryname'
```

- **`find`**  performs real-time searches based on the current state of the file system.
- **`locate`** uses a pre-built index database, making it faster for certain types of searches but requiring periodic updates to ensure the index reflects changes in the file system.

**NOTE** To locate and delete using find command 
```
find /path/to/search -name filename / 'directoryname' -delete
```

### Linux File Type
In Linux, file types refer to the classification of files based on their content and purpose. The type of a file is determined by examining the first few bytes of its content, known as the file signature or magic number. The Linux operating system uses this information to interpret and handle files appropriately.

- Common Linux File Types:

| Name                  | Symbol | Explanation  |
|-----------------------|--------|--------------|
| Regular File          | `-`    | The majority of files on a Linux system. These files can contain any type of data, including text or binary information. They are the most common type of files used for storing user data, programs, or system configuration. |
| Directory             | `d`    | Directories are special files that contain references to other files and directories. They organize the file system structure, allowing users to organize and navigate through their files. The content of a directory is a list of entries, each associated with a filename and an inode number. |
| soft Link (Soft Link) | `l`    | soft links, or soft links, are files that act as pointers or references to other files or directories. They provide a convenient way to create shortcuts or references to files and directories, allowing for flexibility in file organization. |
| Block Device          | `b`    | Block devices represent storage devices that store and retrieve data in fixed-size blocks. Examples include hard drives, solid-state drives, and partitions. Block devices are used for storing large amounts of data in a structured manner. |
| Character Device      | `c`    | Character devices represent devices that transfer data character by character. Examples include terminals, serial ports, and other devices that communicate one character at a time. Character devices are commonly used for input and output operations. |
| FIFO (Named Pipe)     | `p`    | FIFOs, or named pipes, are special files used for interprocess communication. They allow data to be passed between processes in a first-in, first-out manner. FIFOs provide a way for processes to communicate without being directly connected. |
| Socket                | `s`    | Sockets are special files used for interprocess communication, allowing processes to communicate with each other, either on the same system or between different systems. Sockets provide a mechanism for exchanging data between processes using network protocols. |
| Whiteout              | `w`    | Whiteouts are used in some file systems to represent the removal of a file or directory. They indicate that a file or directory has been deleted or removed from the file system. Whiteouts are typically used in union file systems to manage changes to the file system. |

### Linux File Path
In Linux, there are two types of paths: Relative Paths and Absolute Paths.

1. **Relative Path:**
- A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to your current working directory. It doesn't start from the root directory. Examples:

    - **Current Directory:**
      - If your current directory is `/home/user`, then a file in that directory can be referred to using a relative path, such as `file.txt`.

   - **Parent Directory:**
      - To refer to a file in the parent directory, you can use `../` like this: `../parentfile.txt`.

   - **Subdirectory:**
     - To refer to a file in a subdirectory, you can use the subdirectory name, such as `subdir/file.txt`.

2. **Absolute Path:**
- An absolute path specifies the exact location of a file or directory from the root directory. It starts from the root directory, denoted by a forward slash `/`. Examples:

   - **Root Directory:**
     - The absolute path to a file in the root directory is like `/file.txt`.

   - **User's Home Directory:**
     - The absolute path to a user's home directory is like `/home/username`.

   - **Subdirectory:**
     - The absolute path to a file in a subdirectory is like `/path/to/subdirectory/file.txt`.

### Linux Link File
In the context of a Linux file system, a "link" refers to a connection or association between a file name and the actual data on disk. There are two primary types of links in Linux: Hard Links and Soft Links.

1. **Hard Link**
- A hard link is essentially an additional name (directory entry) for an existing file.
- All hard links associated with a file share the same inode (data structure on disk that stores information about a file).
- Deleting one hard link does not affect the others, as they all point to the same data on disk.
- Hard links cannot span across different file systems or partitions.
- Creating Hard Link of a Existing File Named "TestFile"
```
 ln /path/to/file/TestFile
```

2. **Soft Link**
- A soft link is a separate file that contains a path reference to the target file or directory.
- It acts as a pointer or shortcut to another file or directory.
- Soft links have their own inode and can span across different file systems or partitions.
- If the target file or directory is moved or deleted, the soft link becomes "broken."
- Creating Hard Link of a Existing File Named "TestFile"
```
 ln -s /path/to/file/TestFile
```

**`NOTE:`** To check the inode of files and directories:
```
ls -ltri
```

### Linux File and Directory Permissions
In Linux, file and directory permissions are a crucial aspect of system security, determining who can access, modify, or execute files and directories. Each file and directory has associated permissions for three categories of users: the owner, the group, and others.

**Types of Permission**
- **`Read Permission (r),(4)`**
   - For Files: Allows the user to read the contents of the file.
   - For Directories: Allows the user to list the contents of the directory.

- **`Write Permission (w),(2)`** 
   - For Files: Allows modifications to the file, including writing new data to the file, deleting the file, or renaming it. 
   - For Directory: Allows creating, deleting, or renaming files within the directory, delete files within that directory, as well as the directory itself if have write permission on the parent directory.

- **`Execute Permission (x),(1)`**: 
   - For Files: Allows the user to execute the file if it is a program or script.
   - For Directories: Allows the user to access the contents of the directory.

| Numeric Value | Symbolic Representation | Permission Type        |
|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 0             | ---                     | No Permisssion         |
| 1             | --x                     | Execute                |
| 2             | -w-                     | Wrire                  |
| 3             | -wx                     | Execute + Write        |
| 4             | r--                     | Read                   |
| 5             | r-x                     | Read + Execute         |
| 6             | rw-                     | Read + Write           |
| 7             | rwx                     | Read + Write + Execute |

**Example**
```
-rw-r--r-x 1 user user 1024 Dec 23 10:30 example
```
- Owner (user): read and write (rw-)
- Group (user): read-only (r--)
- Others: read and execute (r-x)

**Changing File and Directory Permission Symbolically**
- To change file and directory permissions symbolically, use the chmod command with symbolic representations.
- Symbolic Representation:
   - **`u`** (user/owner)
   - **`g`** (group)
   - **`o`** (others)
   - **`a`** (all, equivalent to ugo)
   - **`+`** (add permission)
   - **`-`** (remove permission)
   - **`=`** (set permission explicitly)
- Syntax:
```
chmod [options] [who] operator permission file
```
- Changing Permission Recursively
```
chmod -R [options] mode directory
```

**Changing File and Directory Permission Numerically**
- To change file and directory permissions numrically, use the chmod command with numeric value.
- Numeric Values:
   - **`Read`**: 4
   - **`Write`**: 2
   - **`Execute`**: 1
- Syntax:
```
chmod [options] file
```
- Changing Permission Recursively
```
chmod -R [options] directory
```

### Special Permissions

1. **Setuid (Set User ID)**
- When an executable file has the setuid permission set, it runs with the privileges of the file's owner, rather than the user who is executing it.
- This is commonly used for programs that need special privileges to perform certain tasks but should be executed by regular users.
- Syntax:
```
chmod u+s filename
```

2. **Setgid (Set Group ID)**
-  When a directory has the setgid permission set, any new files or subdirectories created within that directory inherit the group ownership of the parent directory, rather than the primary group of the user who created them.
- This is commonly used 
- Syntax:
```
chmod g+s directory
```

3. **Sticky Bit**
- The sticky bit is a permission that can be set on a directory. When the sticky bit is set, only the owner of a file within that directory can delete or rename the file.
- This is commonly used on directories like /tmp to prevent users from deleting each other's files.
- Syntax:
```
chmod +t directory
```

### Linux File and Directory Ownership
In Linux, file and directory ownership is a critical aspect of system security, delineating the individuals or entities with specific rights over files and directories. Each file and directory is attributed to an owner and a group, playing a pivotal role in regulating access and control.

**Types of Owner**
- **`User`**
   - The user owner is the individual user account associated with the creation of a file or directory.
   - The user owner has specific permissions on the file, which may include the ability to read, write, or execute the file.
   - The user owner is the primary entity responsible for the file and has the most direct control over it.
- **`Group`**
   - All users in Linux belong to one or more groups.
   - The group owner is a designated group to which the file or directory is associated.
   - Users within the group inherit the group permissions on the respective file, allowing for shared access and collaboration among group members.

**Changing Ownership**
- The chown command is used to change the user and group ownership of a file or directory.
```
sudo chown new_owner:new_group file/directory
```
- To change the ownership recursively
```
sudo chown new_owner:new_group file/directory
```
- The chgrp command is used to change the group ownership of file and directory.
```
sudo chgrp new_group file/directory
```
- To change the ownership recursively
```
sudo chgrp new_group file/directory
```

### Access Control List
ACL, or Access Control Lists, offers a more flexible way to manage permissions on file systems in Linux. It provides additional options beyond the standard file permissions. With ACL, you can grant specific permissions to individual users or groups, allowing access to disk resources without requiring users to be members of a particular group.

**ACL Commands**
- Set ACL for User
```
setfacl -m u:<username>:<permissions> <filename or directory>
```
- Set ACL for Gropu 
```
setfacl -m g:<groupname>:<permissions> <filename or directory>
```
- Remove ACL for User
```
setfacl -x u:<username> <filename or directory>
```
- Remove ACL for Group
```
setfacl -x g:<groupname> <filename or directory>
```
- Set default ACL for a Directory
```
setfacl -d -m u:<username>:<permissions> <directory>
```
- Remove default ACL for a directory
```
setfacl -k <directory>
```
- View ACL for a File or Directory
```
getfacl <filename or directory>
```

## Linux File System and Partition - Partition
In a Linux-based system, a partition refers to a logical division of a physical hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD). Partitions are used to organize and manage the storage space on a disk. Each partition acts as a separate unit, and the operating system treats it as if it were a distinct physical device. Partitions are essential for various reasons, including file system organization, data isolation, and system management.

### Key Aspects Related to Partitions in Linux 

**Partition Table:**
The partition table is a data structure that contains information about the partitions on a storage device. Common partition table formats include MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table).
MBR is an older standard, while GPT is more modern and supports larger storage capacities and more partitions.

- To display information about the partition tables:
```
sudo parted -l
```

**File Systems:**
Each partition typically has its own file system, such as ext4, xfs, btrfs, etc. The file system determines how data is organized and stored on the partition.

- To check the file system used on a particular partition:
```
df -Th
```
- It will display the file system type, size, used space, available space, percentage used, and mount point.
```
lsblk
```
- It will display a hierarchical list of block devices, including partitions and their file system types.

**Mount Points:**
A partition can be mounted at a specific directory in the file system hierarchy. The directory where a partition is mounted is called the mount point. For example, a partition with the home directory might be mounted at /home.

**Device Naming:**
In Linux, storage devices and partitions are represented as files under the /dev directory. For example, the first partition on the first SATA drive might be represented as /dev/sda1.

**Partitioning Tools:**
Linux provides various tools for partitioning, such as fdisk, parted, and gparted. These tools allow you to create, delete, and modify partitions on storage devices.

**Partition Types:**
Partitions can serve different purposes, such as primary partitions, extended partitions, and logical partitions in the MBR partitioning scheme. GPT, on the other hand, doesn't have the concept of extended and logical partitions.

## Linux Fundamentals

### Input and Output Redirects
In Linux, input and output redirects are used to control where the input for a command comes from and where the output goes. These redirects are often performed using special characters in the command line.

**Input Redirects**
1. **`< and << (Redirect Standard Input)`**
- Syntax
```
command < input_file
```
Takes Input From a File.
```
command << delimiter
text
delimiter
```
Takes "text" between delimiter as input.

**Output Redirects**

2. **` > and >> (Redirect Standard Output)`**
- Syntax:
```
command > output_file
```
Redirects Standard Outout to a File.
```
command >> output_file
```
Appends Standard Output to a File.


3. **`2> and 2>> (Redirect Standard Error)`**
- Syntax:
```
command 2> errorfile
```
Redirects Standard Error to a File.
```
command 2>> errorfile
```
Appends Standard Error to a File.


4. **`&> and &>> (Redirect Standard Output and Error)`**
- Syntax:
```
command &> output_and_error_file 
```
Redirects Both Standard Output and Error to a File.
```
command &>> output_and_error_file
```
Appends Both Standard Output and Error to a File.


### PIPE and TEE

**PIPE (|):**
- The pipe command (|) is used to combine two or more commands. It takes the output of one command and uses it as the input for the next command.
- Example: 
```
ls -l | grep "txt"
```
This will lists files in the current directory and then filters the output to show only those containing "txt."

**TEE (tee)**
- The tee command is used to read from standard input and write to standard output and files simultaneously. It can be used to split the output of a command, sending it to both the screen and one or more files.
- Example: 
```
ls -l | tee output.txt
```
This will lists files in the current directory, and the output is both displayed on the screen and saved to a file named "output.txt."

**Example combining PIPE and TEE:**
```
ls -l | tee filelist.txt
```
- In this example, the ls -l command lists files in the current directory, and the output is both displayed on the screen and saved to a file named "filelist.txt."

### File Display

1. **`cat (Concatenate and Display)`**
- The cat command is used to concatenate and display the content of files. It can also be used to create new files, display the contents of multiple files, or append the contents of one file to another.
- Example: 
```
cat file.txt
```

2. **`less`**
- The less command is a pager program that allows you to view the contents of a file one screen at a time. It provides navigation features, allowing you to scroll forward and backward through the text.
- Example: 
```
less document.txt
```

3. **`more`**
- The more command is a pager that displays the contents of a file one screen at a time. It is less feature-rich than less but is available on many systems.
- Example: 
```
more document.txt
```

4. **`head`**
- The head command is used to display the first few lines of a file. By default, it shows the first 10 lines, but you can specify a different number of lines using the -n option.
- Example: 
```
head -n 5 file.txt
```

5. **`tail`**
- The tail command is used to display the last few lines of a file. By default, it shows the last 10 lines, but you can specify a different number of lines using the -n option.
- Example: 
```
tail -n 5 file.txt
```

### Text Processing and Manipulation

1. **`cut`**
- Used to extract specific sections (columns) from each line of a file or from a pipeline of data.
- Example:
```
cut -d',' -f1,3 file.csv
```

2. **`awk`**
- A powerful programming language primarily used for pattern scanning and processing. It operates on a per-line basis.
- Example:
```
awk '{print $2}' file.txt
```

3. **`grep`**
- Searches for a pattern in a file or a stream of text. It outputs lines that match the specified pattern.
- Example:
```
grep "pattern" file.txt
```

4. **`egrep`**
- Extended grep that supports extended regular expressions.
- Example:
```
egrep "pattern1|pattern2" file.txt
```

5. **`sort`** 
- Sorts lines of text files. It can be used for simple text sorting or with options for more complex sorting.
- Example:
```
sort file.txt
```

6. **`uniq`** 
- Removes duplicate consecutive lines from a sorted file. It's often used in conjunction with the sort command.
- Example:
```
sort file.txt | uniq
```

7. **`wc`**
- Stands for word count. It counts lines, words, and characters in a file.
- Example:
```
wc -l file.txt
```

8. **`diff`**
- Compares two files and shows the differences between them.
- Example:
```
diff file1.txt file2.txt
```

9. **`cmp`** 
- Compares two files byte by byte and displays the first mismatch.
- Example:
```
cmp file1.txt file2.txt
```

10. **`sed`**
- `sed` stands for "stream editor," and it is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems for parsing and transforming text. It is commonly used for text processing tasks such as searching, replacing, inserting, or deleting specific lines or patterns in a text file.
- Basic syntax for the `sed` command:
```
sed options script file
``` 
- A few common uses of sed:
   - Search and Replace
      ```
      sed 's/pattern/replacement/' file
      ```
   - Delete Lines
      ```
      sed '/pattern/d' file
      ```
   - Print Specific Lines
      ```
      sed -n '2,5p' file
      ```
   - Insert
      ```
      sed '2i\inserted line' file
      ```
   - Append
      ```
      sed '$a\appended line' file
      ```
   - Multiple Commands
      ```
      sed -e 's/pattern/replacement/' -e '2,5d' file
      ```

### Identity and Access Management 
Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Linux involves the management of user identities, authentication, authorization, and access control on Linux systems. Various tools and protocols are commonly used to achieve effective IAM in Linux environments.

**Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)**
- **Role:** PAM provides a flexible framework for authentication on Linux systems.
- **Usage:** Administrators can configure PAM to use various authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, tokens, or biometrics. It is commonly used to integrate with external authentication systems like LDAP or IDM.

**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**
- **Role:** LDAP is often used for centralized authentication and authorization in Linux environments.
- **Usage:** Linux systems can be configured to query an LDAP directory for user authentication and authorization information. This enables centralized management of user accounts and access policies.

**Identity Management (IDM) Systems**
- **Role:** IDM systems streamline the management of user identities, access rights, and related processes.
- **Usage:** Integrating Linux systems with IDM solutions ensures consistency in user provisioning, de-provisioning, and access control. IDM systems may include features like single sign-on (SSO) for a seamless user experience.

**System Security Services Daemon (SSSD)**
- **Role:** SSSD is a daemon that provides various services related to system security, including user authentication and identity lookups.
- **Usage:** SSSD can be configured to interact with different identity sources, such as LDAP or Active Directory. It helps centralize identity management on Linux systems.

**Kerberos**
- **Role:** Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client-server applications.
- **Usage:** Integrating Linux systems with Kerberos enhances security by enabling encrypted authentication. Kerberos is commonly used in conjunction with LDAP or IDM systems.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Role:** RBAC is a model that defines access permissions based on roles assigned to users.
- **Usage:** Implementing RBAC on Linux involves defining roles and associating them with specific permissions. This approach enhances access control by ensuring users have the necessary permissions for their roles.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Role:** MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification.
- **Usage:** Linux systems can be configured to support MFA, which may include combinations of passwords, tokens, or biometrics. MFA strengthens access controls, especially for critical systems.

**Centralized Logging and Auditing**
- **Role:** Logging and auditing tools help track user activities and changes in the system.
- **Usage:** Centralized logging and auditing facilitate monitoring and analysis of user behavior. This is essential for identifying security incidents and ensuring compliance with security policies.

   - `Uptime:` The system has been running continuously for 6 days and 10 hours and 29 minutes.
   - `Number of Users:` There are currently 2 users logged into the system.
   - `Load Averages:` The load averages represent the system's load over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively. Load averages indicate the average number of processes in the system's run queue over the specified time intervals. In this case, the load averages suggest the following:
      - The 1-minute load average of 1.80 indicates that, on average, there are almost two processes waiting for CPU time over the last minute. This suggests a moderate load.
      - The 5-minute load average of 1.63 is slightly lower than the 1-minute load average. It represents a slightly smoothed-out view of the system load over the last 5 minutes.
      - The 15-minute load average of 1.60 is also lower than the 1-minute load average and provides an even more smoothed-out view over the last 15 minutes.

### Processes and Jobs

### Processes
In Linux, a process is the active execution of a program, involving data from files, user input, and program instructions. Processes are initiated when applications are launched, programs run, or commands executed. Each program or command creates a single process, while applications can generate multiple processes for various tasks. Linux processes typically originate by forking from a parent process.

**Types of Processes**
1. **Parent and Child Process:** A child process is a Linux process that is created by another process known as the parent process. A child process can be created using one of two methods. The first method is the fork system call, which is often used in Unix-like operating systems, whereas the second method is the spawn method, which is preferred in the modern NT kernel of Microsoft Windows. A process is considered a parent process if it creates one or more child (subprocess) processes.

2. **Zombie and Orphan Process:** A zombie process is a Linux process that has finished its execution but still has an entry in the process table. Zombie processes usually get created when a child process completes its execution but the parent process has yet to read its exit status. An orphan process is a process that continues to run even after the parent process has been completed or terminated. An orphan process can be intentionally or unintentionally created.

3. **Daemon Process:** Daemon processes are system-related background processes. These processes often run the permissions of root and service requests from other processes. Daemon processes often run in the background, waiting for specified events or tasks to occur. Daemon processes, unlike regular processes, do not require a controlling terminal to operate.

**States of Processes**
- **`R (Running)`**: The process is either running on a CPU or is ready to run.
- **`S (Sleeping)`**: The process is sleeping, meaning it is waiting for an event to occur. It is not currently using the CPU.
- **`D (Uninterruptible Sleep)`**: The process is in an uninterruptible sleep state, typically waiting for I/O (input/output) operations to complete. It cannot be easily interrupted by signals.
- **`Z (Zombie)`**: The process has terminated but has not yet been removed from the process table. This state occurs when a child process has finished, but the parent process has not yet collected its exit status.
- **`T (Stopped)`**: The process has been stopped, often by receiving a SIGSTOP signal. It is not currently running, and it can be resumed with a SIGCONT signal.
- **`W (Paging)`**: The process is swapped out, meaning it has been moved to the swap space on disk. It is waiting for a page-in operation to bring it back into memory.
- **`< (High Priority)`**: The process has a high scheduling priority. It is given preference in CPU scheduling.
- **`N (Low Priority)`**: The process has a low scheduling priority. It is deprioritized in CPU scheduling.
- **`L (Multithreaded)`**: The process is multithreaded, indicating it contains multiple threads of execution. It might be a member of a multithreaded process group.
- **`+ (Foreground Process Group)`**: The process is in the foreground process group. This is often associated with terminal sessions.
- **`s (Session Leader)`**: The process is the session leader for its session.
- **`l (Is Multi-threaded)`**: The process is multi-threaded, and additional information about the threads (LWP - Lightweight Processes) is available.

**Process Commands**
1. **`ps`**: 
- The ps command in Unix-like operating systems (including Linux) is used to provide information about currently running processes.
- Example:
   ```
   ps aux | grep https
   ```
- Command Explanation:
   - `ps`: It stands for "process status" and is a command used to provide information about the currently running processes on a Unix-like operating system.
   - `aux`: These are options passed to the ps command. Specifically:
      - `a`: Show information about all users.
      - `u`: Display more detailed information, including the user who owns the process, the CPU and memory usage, and the start time.
      - `x`: Include processes not attached to a terminal. This is often used to show a more comprehensive list of processes, including those running in the background.
   - So, ps aux is used to display a detailed list of all currently running processes on the system, including those owned by all users and those running in the background.
   - `|` : This symbol takes the output of the command on its left (ps aux) and uses it as input for the command on its right (grep https).
   - `grep https`: The grep command, filters the lines containing the term "https" from the output of "ps aux".

- Output:
```
no-one           10621   0.0  0.0 408636112   1472 s002  S+   11:54AM   0:00.01 grep https
```
- Output Explanation:
   - `no-one`: This is the username of the process.
   - `10621`: This is the process ID (PID) of the grep process.
   - `0.0`: The CPU usage of the process.
   - `0.0`: The memory (RAM) usage of the process.
   - `408636112`: The virtual memory size of the process.
   - `1472`: The RSS (Resident Set Size), which is the portion of the process's memory held in RAM.
   - `s002`: The terminal or session ID where the process is running.
   - `S+`: The process state, where "S" indicates it's in the interruptible sleep state.
   - `11:54AM`: The start time of the process.
   - `0:00.01`: The cumulative CPU time the process has used.
   - `grep https`: The command that is being executed.

2. **`kill`**:  
- It allows you to gracefully stop a process or forcefully terminate it.
- Example: 
   ```
   kill -9 921
   ```
- Command Explanation:
   - `kill`: The command used to send signals to processes.
   - `-9`: Specifies the signal to be sent, in this case, it's SIGKILL (signal number 9).
   - `921`: The Process ID (PID) of the target process.

- Types of Signals Sent By Kill Command
   - `SIGHUP (1)`: This signal is often used to instruct a process to reload its configuration files.
   - `SIGINT (2)`: This signal is typically generated by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal. It is often used to interrupt a running process.
   - `SIGKILL (9)`: This is a forceful termination signal that immediately terminates the specified process without giving it a chance to perform any cleanup.
   - `SIGTERM (15)`: This is the default signal sent by the kill command. It allows the process to perform cleanup before terminating.

### Jobs
In Unix-like operating systems, a job refers to the execution of a program or command within a shell session. A job can consist of one or more processes and is often associated with tasks performed in the foreground or background. Jobs are managed by the shell, allowing users to control their execution and monitor their status.

**Types of Jobs**
1. **Foreground Job:** A foreground job is a task that is currently being executed in the active shell session. The shell waits for the foreground job to complete before accepting further commands. To run a command in the foreground, it is simply entered without any special backgrounding notation.

2. **Background Job:** A background job is a task that runs independently of the active shell session, allowing the user to continue entering commands. To run a command in the background, the ampersand (&) symbol is appended to the command.

**States of Jobs**
- **`Running`**: The job is currently being executed.
- **`Stopped`**: The job has been paused or stopped, often by receiving a SIGSTOP signal. It can be resumed with a SIGCONT signal.
- **`Done`**: The job has completed its execution successfully.
- **`Terminated`**: The job has terminated, possibly due to an error.

**Job Commands**
1. **`jobs`**: 
- The jobs command is used to display a list of current jobs running in the active shell session. Each job is assigned a unique job number.
- Example:
   ```
   jobs
   ```
- Explanation: 
   - When you run this command, it provides information about the status of jobs, including their job number, status (running, stopped, or done), and the command associated with each job.

2. **`fg`**: 
- The fg command is used to bring a background job into the foreground for active execution.
- Example:
   ```
   fg %1
   ```
- Explanation: 
   - The fg %1 commands brings the job with number 1 to the foreground, allowing us to interact with it directly.

3. **`bg`**: 
- The bg command is used to resume a stopped or suspended job in the background.
- Example:
   ```
   bg %2
   ```
- Explanation: 
   - The bg %2 command resumes the job number 2 in the background, allowing it to continue execution without bringing it to the foreground.

4. **`kill`**:
- It allows you to gracefully stop a job or forcefully terminate it..
- Example:
   ```
   kill -9 %3
   ```
- Explanation:
   - `kill`: The command used to send signals to processes.
   - `-9`: Specifies the signal to be sent, in this case, it's SIGKILL (signal number 9).
   - `%3`:  The job number of the target job. The percent sign (%) is used to indicate that the following number refers to a job, not a process.

- Types of Signals Sent By Kill Command
   - `SIGHUP (1)`: This signal is often used to instruct a process to reload its configuration files.
   - `SIGINT (2)`: This signal is typically generated by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal. It is often used to interrupt a running process.
   - `SIGKILL (9)`: This is a forceful termination signal that immediately terminates the specified process without giving it a chance to perform any cleanup.
   - `SIGTERM (15)`: This is the default signal sent by the kill command. It allows the process to perform cleanup before terminating.


### Systemd
Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to replace the traditional SysV init system, offering more features and capabilities. Systemd is responsible for managing various aspects of the system, including the initialization process, services, devices, and more. Some key features of systemd include:

1. **Service Management**: Systemd manages system services, daemons, and other processes. It can start, stop, restart, and monitor services, providing better control and management compared to traditional init scripts.

2. **Parallelization**: Systemd can start services in parallel, improving boot times and system responsiveness.

3. **Dependency Management**: Services can specify dependencies on other services or system resources, ensuring that they start or stop in the correct order.

8. **systemd-nspawn**: Offering lightweight container management capabilities, systemd-nspawn facilitates the creation and management of Linux containers. It leverages systemd-nspawn containers to provide isolated environments for testing, development, and deployment purposes. With minimal overhead and integration with systemd's ecosystem, systemd-nspawn enables efficient containerization on Linux systems.

#### Systemd Units
- In systemd, a "unit" is a fundamental concept used to represent various types of system resources or entities that systemd manages. A unit can be a service, a socket, a device, a mount point, a automount point, a timer, or even a target, which is a grouping mechanism.
- Systemd units are managed using the systemctl command-line tool, which allows starting, stopping, enabling, disabling, reloading, and querying the status of units, among other operations.

**Unit File Location**
1. **` /etc/systemd/system`**: Contains custom unit files and overrides.
2. **` /run/systemd/system`**: Contains runtime-generated unit files.
3. **` /lib/systemd/system`**: Contains default unit files provided by installed software packages.

**Types of Systemd Unit Files**
- Systemd unit files are used to define and manage various aspects of system behavior. Each unit is represented by a configuration file with an extension indicating its purpose. These files contain directives that specify how the unit should behave, including dependencies, execution commands, environment variables, and more. Here are the common types of systemd unit files:

1. **Service Unit Files (.service)**: These define System Services or Daemons. They specify how to start, stop, and manage a particular service. Service unit files usually include information such as the path to the executable, arguments, dependencies, and more.

2. **Socket Unit Files (.socket)**: These define IPC or Network Sockets. They can be used to activate services on demand when incoming connections are detected on the associated socket.

3. **Device Unit Files (.device)**: These define Kernel Devices or Other Hardware Devices. They specify how to manage device nodes, permissions, and other settings.

4. **Mount Unit Files (.mount)**: These define mount points for filesystems. They specify how to mount and manage filesystems, including options like where to mount them and which filesystem type to use.

5. **Target Unit Files (.target)**: These are used for grouping units together for a common purpose, such as starting up or shutting down the system. Targets are similar to runlevels in traditional init systems.

6. **Timer Unit Files (.timer)**: These define timer-based activation of other units. They are used to schedule the activation of other units at specific times or intervals.

7. **Snapshot Unit Files (.snapshot)**: These define system state snapshots. Snapshots are used to save the current state of the system, including which units are active or inactive, and can be used to restore the system to a previous state.

8. **Scope Unit Files (.scope)**: These define an execution environment for processes launched by systemd. They are used to manage groups of processes and their resources.

9. **Automount Unit Files (.automount)**: These define automount points for filesystems. They are used to automatically mount filesystems upon access, rather than at boot time. 

### Environment and Environment Variables

### Environment
In Linux, the environment refers to a collection of settings and rules that define the context in which a process runs. This environment includes information like the current user, the process's permissions, system settings, and much more. The environment is a part of the system that provides essential information to the operating system and to the applications running on it.

**Key Components of the Environment in Linux**

1. **Environment Variables**: Environment variables are dynamic values that are set at the system level and can be used by programs and scripts to configure their behavior. Common environment variables include PATH (specifying directories to search for executable files), HOME (the user's home directory), USER (the username of the current user), and many others. You can view and set environment variables using commands like export, echo, and env.
2. **Shell Environment**: Each user in Linux typically has a default shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh) that provides an interactive command-line interface. The shell environment includes settings, aliases, and customizations specific to the user's preferences. Users can customize their shell environment by modifying configuration files like .bashrc or .zshrc.
3. **Execution Environment**: When you run a program or a script in Linux, it inherits the environment variables and settings from the shell or context in which it was launched. This includes the current working directory, file permissions, and other relevant information that may affect its execution.
4. **System Environment**: Linux distributions often include system-wide environment variables and configurations that apply to all users. These settings are typically stored in system-wide configuration files and directories, such as /etc or /usr/share. System administrators can modify these settings to affect system behavior.
5. **Graphic User Interface (GUI) Environment**: In addition to the command-line environment, Linux desktop environments like GNOME, KDE, and Xfce provide graphical user interfaces with their own sets of environment variables and settings. These environments control aspects like the desktop appearance, window management, and system preferences.
6. **Networking Environment**: Linux manages network-related configurations and settings as part of its environment. This includes network interfaces, IP addresses, DNS servers, firewall rules, and routing tables.
7. **Virtual Environment**: Linux supports virtualization technologies like Docker and virtual machines (e.g., using KVM or VirtualBox). Each virtual environment can have its own isolated environment with its own set of configurations and resources.

### Environment Variables
Environment variables are a specific type of variable in Linux that the operating system and other applications use to find out information about the environment. These variables store data such as configurations, file paths, and system settings, and they are used by both the system and applications to tailor behavior.

**Examples of Environment Variables**

- **`PATH`**: Stores a list of directories where the system looks for executable files when you enter a command in the terminal.
- **`HOME`**: Represents the user's home directory.
- **`USER`**: Stores the name of the currently logged-in user.
- **`LANG`**: Specifies the default language and locale settings for the system.
- **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**: Contains directories where the system looks for shared libraries used by programs.
- **`JAVA_HOME`**: Points to the installation directory of Java on the system.

**Scope of Environment Variable**
- Understanding the scope of an environment variable is essential, as it determines where the variable can be accessed or defined and establishes a clear distinction between global and local scopes.
   - **Global Environment Variables**: Global environment variables, when defined in a terminal, are accessible from any part of that terminal's environment. This means they can be utilized by scripts, programs, or processes running within the entire scope of that terminal.
   - **Local Environment Variables**: In contrast, local environment variables are restricted to the specific terminal in which they are defined. They remain isolated from external programs or processes, limiting their reach to only the terminal where they were created.

**Accessing Environment Variable**
- Accessing environment variables is consistently straightforward, whether local or global. You retrieve their values using the below syntax which holds true across various scopes.
- Syntax:
```
VARIABLE_NAME
```
- Examle:
```
$PATH
```

**Displaying Environment Variable**

1. **`set Command`** 
- The `set` command lists all environment variables, encompassing both global and local variables.
- Example:
   ```
   set
   ```

2. **`env Command`**
- The `env` command display all global environment variables and their values. 
- Example:
   ```
   env
   ```

3. **`echo Command`**
- The echo command  display the value of an environment variable.
- Example: To display the value of the PATH environment variable run:
   ```
   echo PATH
   ```

4. **`printenv Command`**
- The printenv command is another way to display the values of environment variables. 
-Example:
   ```
   printenv PATH
   ```

5. **`Accessing Environment Variables in Scripts`**
- In shell scripts, environment variables ca be accessed by using the $VAR_NAME syntax. 
-Example, to access the value of the HOME variable in a script:
   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "The home directory is: $HOME"
   ```

6. **`$ Symbol and Curly Braces`**
- For accessing environment variables within a string, it's a good practice to use curly braces ${VAR_NAME} to make it clear where the variable name begins and ends. 
- Eexample:
   ```
   echo "My variable is: ${MY_VARIABLE}"
   ```

7. **`Setting and Exporting Environment Variables`**
- Environment variables can set and exported using the export command. - Example: To set and export a variable named MY_VARIABLE with a value of "Hello World," run:
   ```
   export MY_VARIABLE="Hello World"
   ```
- After exporting, the variable will be accessible to other processes.


## Important Linux Commands

### Secure File Transfer Between Remote Servers
- Transferring files securely between remote servers in Linux can be accomplished using the scp (secure copy) command, leveraging SSH (Secure Shell) for encrypted file transfer. Here are key commands:

- Copy from Local to Remote:
```
scp [options] source_file_or_directory user@destination_server:destination_path
```
   - Options:
      - `-r`: Recursively copy entire directories.
      - `-P port`: Specify the port number for the SSH connection (default is 22).

# BASH

## Introduction

Bash, or the Bourne Again Shell, is a powerful and widely used command processor and scripting language in Unix-like operating systems. It serves as the default shell for many Linux distributions and macOS.

### Some Key Aspects of Bash:

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Bash provides a text-based interface where users can interact with the operating system by typing commands. Users can perform various tasks, such as navigating the file system, running programs, and managing files.

2. **Syntax and Commands:** Bash commands typically follow a simple syntax. A command is usually composed of the command name followed by options and arguments. For example:
```
ls -l /path/to/directory
```

3. **Variables:** Bash allows the use of variables to store and retrieve data. Variable names are case-sensitive and conventionally written in uppercase. For example:
```
greeting="Hello, Bash!"
echo $greeting
```
4. **Shell Scripts:** Bash is also a scripting language. Users can write scripts, which are sequences of Bash commands saved in a file. These scripts can be executed to automate repetitive tasks or perform complex operations. A simple Bash script might look like this:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, This is a Bash Script!"
```
5. **Control Flow:** Bash supports conditional statements (if, elif, else) and loops (for, while) to control the flow of execution in scripts. This allows for decision-making and repetition within scripts.

6. **Functions:** Bash allows users to define functions, which are blocks of reusable code. Functions help in organizing and modularizing scripts, making them more maintainable.

7. **Redirection and Pipes:** Bash provides features for input/output redirection and piping. This allows users to send the output of one command as input to another, or redirect input and output to and from files.

8. **Wildcards and Globbing:** Bash supports wildcards, such as * and ?, for pattern matching and file manipulation. This makes it easy to work with multiple files or directories at once.

9. **Command History:** Bash keeps a history of previously executed commands, allowing users to recall and reuse them. Navigation through command history is possible using the arrow keys or specific commands.

10. **Configuration Files:** Users can customize their Bash environment by modifying configuration files like .bashrc or .bash_profile. These files can contain aliases, environment variable settings, and other customizations.

**NOTE:** Bash is a versatile tool with a wide range of capabilities, making it a fundamental component for both casual users and system administrators in Unix-like environments. Learning Bash can significantly enhance your ability to work efficiently in a command-line interface and automate tasks through scripting.

- Definition and history of Bash
- Features and advantages of Bash scripting

### Definition and History of Bash

**Bash (Bourne Again SHell):**
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell (sh). It is the default shell on most Unix-like operating systems and is widely used for scripting and automation tasks.

**History:**
- Bash was first released in 1989 and has since become one of the most widely used shells.
- It is an evolution of the Bourne shell (sh) designed by Stephen Bourne, which was the default shell for Unix systems.
- Bash incorporates features from the Bourne shell and the C shell (csh) and provides additional improvements.

### Features and Advantages of Bash Scripting

**1. Powerful Scripting Language:**
   - Bash is not just a command-line interpreter; it's a scripting language that allows the creation of complex programs and automation scripts.
   - It supports variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and other programming constructs.

**2. Portability:**
   - Bash is available on a wide range of Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS, making scripts written in Bash highly portable.

**3. Interactive Shell:**
   - Bash provides an interactive shell, allowing users to execute commands and navigate the file system efficiently.
   - Features like command history, tab completion, and customizable prompts enhance the interactive user experience.

**4. Extensibility:**
   - Bash can be extended with custom functions and scripts, enabling users to create their own tools and utilities.
   - It supports aliases, which are user-defined shortcuts for longer commands.

**5. Job Control:**
   - Bash supports job control, allowing users to run multiple processes in the background, foreground, or suspend/resume processes.
   - This feature is beneficial for managing and monitoring tasks.

**6. Pipelines and Redirection:**
   - Bash supports the creation of powerful command pipelines, allowing the output of one command to be used as the input for another.
   - Input and output redirection enable the manipulation of files and streams.

**7. Conditional Statements and Looping:**
   - Bash scripts can include conditional statements (if-else) and various types of loops (for, while) for effective decision-making and iteration.

**8. Regular Expressions:**
   - Bash supports regular expressions for pattern matching, providing powerful string manipulation capabilities.

**9. Automation and Task Automation:**
   - Bash scripting is widely used for automating repetitive tasks, making it a valuable tool for system administrators and developers.

**10. Community Support:**
    - Due to its widespread use, there is a large and active community that provides support, resources, and a wealth of pre-existing scripts and tools. 

### Some Basic Important Commands

1. **`echo $SHELL`**: It will display the path of the current shell.  If the output is /bin/bash it indicates that your default shell is Bash.
2. **`which bash`**:  It will display the path to the Bash executable. If the output is /usr/bin/bash it indicates that the Bash executable is located at /usr/bin/bash.


## Module 2: Bash Scripting Syntax

### 2.1 Basic Syntax
- Introduction to the Syntax of BASH

### Introduction to the Syntax of BASH

Bash scripting involves understanding and utilizing a specific syntax to create functional and efficient scripts. The basic syntax includes essential elements for writing scripts in the Bash shell.

1. **Shebang**
- The shebang is a crucial part of Bash scripts. It informs the system about the interpreter to be used for executing the script.

```
#!/bin/bash
```

2. **`echo`**
- The echo command in Bash is used to display text or output to the terminal.
- Example
```
echo "Hello Everyone, Welocme to Bash Scripting."
```

3. **Comments**
- Comments are used for providing explanations within the script. They begin with the # symbol.
- Writing a Single Line Comment
```
# This is a commant.
```

- Writing a Multi-Line Comments
```
: <<'COMMENT'
This is a Multiline Comment.
It can span multiple lines without using individual comment symbols.
COMMENT
```

4. **Quoting**
- Quoting is essential for handling spaces, special characters, and allowing variable substitution.
- `Single Quotes`: Preserves literal meaning.
```
echo 'This is a single-quoted string'
```
- `Double Quotes`: Allow variable substitution
```
echo "Hello, $name"'!'
```

### 2.2 Variables and Data Types

- Declaring and Using Variables
- Basic Data Types (Strings, Integers, Boolean, Arrays, Associative Arrays)

### Declaring and Using Variables

1. **Declaring Variable**
- A variable can be declare by assigning a value to it. Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Declaration with Assignment
```
name="ABHISHEK"
```
- Declaration without Assignment
```
name= 
```
2. **Using Variables**
- We can use variables in various ways, such as printing their values or incorporating them into commands.
- Using Variables in `echo`
```
echo "Hello, $name!"
```
- Using variables in `Command`
```
current_date=$(date)
echo "Today is $current_date"
```
3. **Unsetting Variables**
- We can unset (delete) a variable using the unset command.
- Example
```
name="ABHISHEK"
unset name
echo $name
```

4. **Special Variables**
- Bash also has special variables that are predefined and carry specific information, such as $HOME, $PWD, $USER, etc.
```
echo "Home directory: $HOME"
echo "Current working directory: $PWD"
echo "Username: $USER"
```
5. **Variable Naming Rules**
- Variable names are case-sensitive (name and Name are different).
- They can include letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or underscore.
- Avoid using special characters or spaces in variable names.
- Conventionally, variable names are in uppercase for environment variables, and lowercase for local variables.
